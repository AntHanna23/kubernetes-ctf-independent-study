# CTFd 

CTFd is a Capture The Flag (CTF) framework designed for ease of use for both administrators and users. During the administration of CSAW CTF, the need for an easy to use, yet powerful CTF website was identified. I, as an organizer, was tired of writing raw and risky SQL queries alongside spaghetti PHP code.
